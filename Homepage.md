My name is Ethan, I am an aspiring programmer looking to build comprehensive and unique software and web apps.
I currently attend Florida Polytechnic University pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

Here is a link to a project I worked on recently:
https://github.com/redsio/Gamified-Testing-Software

It is a quiz game about mobile security and basic protection techniques written in JavaScript.
